On October 26th, at the the [Drupal Camp Montréal](http://www.drupalcampmontreal.com/), I made a presentation on the
usage of JavaScript in the context of a Drupal site. I think the presentation went fine, and it seems a few people in
the audience enjoyed and, more importantly, learned something out of it.

The presentation is the result of all the feedbacks I got on the first public version of my previous post, originally
written internally at [Phéromone](http://pheromone.ca) and then [shared on corderwall](https://coderwall.com/p/kd-4cg).
Since all the developers working with Drupal who read it told nme they learned something from it, I figured way too much
developers don't known about what I think are the basics of working with JavaScript in Drupal.

The slides for this presentation are, since a few weeks, available online at [http://pbuyle.github.io/dcmtl-javascript](http://pbuyle.github.io/dcmtl-javascript).
